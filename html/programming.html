"How many bits are there in a byte?" 
I was fresh out of the university and got
this question during a job interview. I answered quickly, but hesitant, wondering
what trap lay ahead.  The interviewer picked up on my hesitation and explained
that some candidates forget the abc's of computer science, especially if
they've been in the industry a few years.  They wanted to make sure I still
could work with the basics. 

Forgetting things we learn is natural. Even MIT students have been found in a
study to forget some of their lessons from e.g. physics.  It does make me
wonder though, if I as a developer should go back to basics every once in a
while to freshen up. It can also be a good thing to remind yourself of why you
  got into programming int he first place! I've been working on  https://github.com/kwrl/qwde/ lately. I originally wanted to keep it clean of enterprise habits and large third parties.
  I wrote the web server initially using java's built in sockets. I then had troubles with threads, dealing with unexpected end-of-streams and some other mumbo-jumbo. It served as a good reminder
  that not all big frameworks are that bad - after switching to micronaut all the problems went away, and I had less code to worry about.
