Qwde (<a href="http://qwde.no">http://qwde.no</a>) is a project outside of work. 
The primary goal is to explore technology. Go fast and break things.  I'm not making perfect posts or code, <a href="https://medium.com/startup-leadership/the-best-way-to-learn-something-make-a-lot-of-pots-7f4aa97e1d3a">I'm just making a lot of pots</a>. 

Qwde is a name that comes from mashing the keyboard. Maybe it will find its way to become something like "Quantitative Wicket De Minimis"? Or something recursive and GNU-ish as "Qwde Was Deliberately Erratic"?

Several posts in the blog are inspired by topics I've heard at <a href="https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/">IQ2US</a>. I recommend their podcasts, youtube videos and endeavour to improve civil conduct in debates.
