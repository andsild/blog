Qwde (http://qwde.no) is a project outside of work. 
The primary goal is to explore technology. Go fast and break things.  Im not making perfect posts or code, following the principles quoted in this medium article: https://medium.com/startup-leadership/the-best-way-to-learn-something-make-a-lot-of-pots-7f4aa97e1d3a

Several posts in the blog are inspired by topics I've heard at IQ2US (https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/). I recommend their podcasts, youtube videos and endeavour to improve civil conduct in debates.

The source code for the blog is hosted on https://github.com/andsild/blog.
The source code for the rest of qwde.no is hosted on https://github.com/kwrl/qwde/
