Qwde (http://qwde.no) is a project outside of work. 
The primary goal is to explore technology. Go fast and break things. Code to get joy, not a paycheck. 

Several posts in the blog are inspired by topics I've heard at IQ2US (https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/). I recommend to all their podcasts, youtube videos and their endeavour to fight for civil conduct in debates.

The source code for the blog is hosted on https://github.com/andsild/blog.
