title: How to (actually) Write Code
---

I was playing the first-person-shooter video game Apex Legends, and I began thinking: Apex is a pretty __boring__ video game, lots of time is spent searching for enemies and looting, and a lot of the random teammates you play with are not polite to say the least. It's still a pretty intense game, since the pace is usually high with little idle time. Apart from competetiveness, there's actually a lot of similiarities to writing simple code (when you know what to write). Could I extract some of my motivation to play video games and become more productive?

For me, it turns out I could. It can really be quite simple to write code. Yes, testing will spot bugs earlier. Yes, having merge requests reviewed will teach you a lot. Yes, singleton is an antipattern that will eventually eat your codebase. And yes, planning out your code can save you a lot of time. But if you've had a long day, it's a lot easier to just drop in on your programming projects if you just hack out some code. If you know that you can make something work with five nested `for loops`, __go ahead__. If you want to combine programming languages in a single solution, __go ahead__. It's better than leaving code to collect dust (if your goal indeed is to write more code).  Anyhow, writing good code is often easier on the heels of bad code, since you'll understand more about the domain. 

So instead of asking yourself if you are a good programmer that writes good code, maybe it's better to just write whatever you feel like and focus on your own joy and on being productive.
 One important aspect of this too, in my opinion, is that a lot of people misperceive that "good code", often minimized, isn't inherently better, its just adapted more for the __actual__ requirements at the given time. You might stumble onto a codebase and wonder what the hell happened, but in all likelyhood, someone started out with something simple and then adapted their code for changing demands. 

 [Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design](https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html) is one of my favorite web sites, and he puts what I'm trying to say much more succinct:
 14. (Edison's Law) "Better is the enemy of "good"
