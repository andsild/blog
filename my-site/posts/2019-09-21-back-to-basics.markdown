title: Back to Basics

_"How many bits are there in a byte?"_  
I was fresh out of the university and got this question during a job interview. I answered hesitantly, wondering what trap lay ahead. The interviewer picked up on my hesitation and explained that some candidates forget the abc's of computer science, especially if
they've been in the industry a few years. They wanted to make sure I still could work with the basics. 

The FizzBuzz interviewing question is kind of the same thing, really. The technique needed to solve fizzbuzz is pretty simple, but it requires that you remember the modulus operator.

Forgetting things we have leart is natural. Even MIT students have been found in a study to forget some of their lessons from e.g. physics. 
I've felt the same about programming, so for <a href="https://github.com/andsild/qwde/">qwde.no</a>, I wrote a web server using java's built in sockets. Then I had several problems; connections were left in FIN_WAIT_2, threading caused mysterious socket write exceptions and some other mumbo-jumbo. I did learn a lot, and realized I haven't always been a TCP expert, and it reminded me that not all big frameworks are bad. After switching to <a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a> all the problems went away, and I had less code to worry about.

The lesson? Overall, we don't we need to remember everything to do what we do. Going back to where you started is also a great lesson in humility.
