A gif can express a thousand words, but sometimes, a clever quote or principle can be enough.

# Principles
Chesterton's fence: if you meet a fence and you don't see why it's needed, don't remove it. There probably was a good reason :)

Akins' 36th law: Any run-of-the-mill engineer can design something which is elegant. A good engineer designs systems to be efficient. A great engineer designs them to be effective.

Akin's 5th law (citing Miller): Three points determine a curve.

# Quotes I've caught in the wild
It's okay to swear in the code, since it lets other developers know where the difficult parts are.

Managing complexity, runtime and dependencies are useful skills in programming, managing your energy and motivation are essential skills.

The Programmers’ Credo: we do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy

# Quotes I've caught from other sources:
"Developers are drawn to complexity like moths to a flame, often with the same outcome." – The Productive Programmer by Neal Ford
